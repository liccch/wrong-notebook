# Global Rules for Antigravity Agent
1. **Language Requirement**: 
   - You MUST use **Chinese (Simplified)** for ALL outputs.
   - This includes:
     - **Internal Thought Process & Reasoning** (MUST BE IN CHINESE).
     - Conversational responses.
     - Task summaries and status updates.
     - Artifact content (task.md, implementation_plan.md, walkthrough.md, etc.).
     - Code comments and documentation strings.
     - Commit messages (unless specified otherwise).
2. **Artifact Localization**:
   - Ensure specific terms in artifacts are translated appropriately (e.g., "Implementation Plan" -> "实施计划", "Verification" -> "验证").
